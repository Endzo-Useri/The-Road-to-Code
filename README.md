# The-Road-to-Code
Here is my creative time. This is where I take what I have learned
and start applying it freestyle. This will be an ongoing work of love
in progress. I hope that you enjoy my blog as much as I am going
to enjoy creating it!

On 26 August 2021 I was in Barstow, CA experiencing challenges with getting my rig a PM (oil change)
I successfully made one Commit through my cell phone to keep my current streak intact as opposed to 
just letting the day go by.
