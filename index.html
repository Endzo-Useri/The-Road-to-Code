            <h1>Welcome to The Road to Code!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my blog and thank you for taking a moment of your time to learn more about my journey. I am going to share my story of how I went from driving over the road as a professional long haul truck driver to the passion that I have embraced in learning to code.</p>

                <h2>The Summer of '15</h2>
                <div class="col">
                    <p>During the summer of 2015 my life took a turn for the best!  This is the year that I met and married my precious wife. I'll   share that story another time.</p>

                    <p>We had enough money put away that we agreed that I should    take the summer off and focus on getting my CDL (Commercial    Driver's License).</p>
